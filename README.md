# Android-App-image-detection
In this project I will create an Android App to detect furniture and objects.
We will use the following tools:
* Android Studio
* Anaconda (Python Distribution)
* TensorFlow

# Installation
To be able to use the code of this repositoy, we must install some tools and libraries following the next order:

## Android Studio
Android Studio is the main tool designed specifically for Android Development.
This link "https://developer.android.com/studio" takes us to the web to download it. You only have to follow the steps of the installer.
()If you have any difficulties to install it, you could follow this guide "https://developer.android.com/studio/install"

## Anaconda (Python Distribution)

## Tensorflow Library
1) We will open a new Terminal
2) We will Create and activate a new virtual environment using the following command:
