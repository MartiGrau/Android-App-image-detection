# Android-App-image-detection
In this project I will create an Android App to detect furniture and objects.
We will use the following tools:
* Android Studio
* Anaconda (Python Distribution)
* TensorFlow

# Installation
To be able to use the code of this repositoy, we must install some tools and libraries following the next order:

## Android Studio
Android Studio is the main tool designed specifically for Android Development.  
This link [AndroidStudio](https://developer.android.com/studio) takes us to the web to download it. You only have to follow the steps of the installer.  
- If you have any difficulties to install it, you could follow this [Guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/install)

## Anaconda (Python Distribution)
Anaconda is a free open-source distribution of Python and R programming languages. We will use this tool to be able to install all the depencies, needed libraries and run our project.  
This link [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) takes us to the web to download it.  
- If you have any difficulties to install it, you could follow this [Guide](https://problemsolvingwithpython.com/01-Orientation/01.03-Installing-Anaconda-on-Windows/)

## TensorFlow Library
1) We will open a new Terminal
2) We will Create and activate a new virtual environment using the following command:
```
conda create -n myenv python=3.6
```
```
conda activate myenv
```
3) Finally we will install the TensorFlow packages
```
pip install tensorflow
```
